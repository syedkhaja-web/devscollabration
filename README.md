## üöÄ How to Run This Project Locally

To get this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. We recommend using the **LTS** version. Installing Node.js will also install `npm`, which is required.

### 2. Clone the Repository

If you're cloning an existing project, use this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedkhaja-web/Devsk72.git
cd Devsk72
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once inside the directory, install all the required project packages by running:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Finally, start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).


## üîó How to Connect to a New GitHub Repository

If you started this project locally and want to push it to a new, empty repository on GitHub, follow these steps:

1.  **Initialize Git:** If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project folder.
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add the Remote URL:** Connect your local repository to the one on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/syedkhaja-web/devscollabration.git
    ```

3.  **Stage and Commit Your Files:** Add all your project files to the staging area and create your first commit.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Set the Main Branch:** Ensure your main branch is named `main`.
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

5.  **Push Your Code:** Push your local code to the GitHub repository.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
After this, your project will be connected, and you can simply use `git push` for future updates.

## ü§ñ Running Genkit AI Flows

To run the AI flows locally for development and testing, use the following command in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```
This will start the Genkit development server and automatically reload your flows when you make changes.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for deployment to **Firebase App Hosting**. For the best experience, we recommend setting up automated deployments by connecting your GitHub repository in the Firebase Console.

Alternatively, you can deploy manually from your machine if your environment is configured correctly.

```bash
firebase deploy --only apphosting
```

##  troubleshooting

If you see an error like `'npm' is not recognized...` or `ENOENT`, it means your computer cannot find the `npm` command. This usually happens if Node.js is not installed correctly or if its location is not in your system's `PATH`.

1.  **Install Node.js:** Download and install the LTS version from [nodejs.org](httpss://nodejs.org/). The installer should automatically add it to your `PATH`.
2.  **Restart Your Terminal/Computer:** After installing, completely close and re-open your terminal or VS Code. A full computer restart can also help ensure the new `PATH` is loaded.
